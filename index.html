        <h2>About</h2><br>
        <p>Experienced Project Management professional, specializing in the implementation and 
          management of complex systems. I have implemented projects ranging from faith-based reentry teams 
          for high-risk sex offenders to ERP systems (SYMIX and Fourth Shift). 
          These implementations have included developing training curriculum, 
          leading small and large-group trainings, and evaluating the effectiveness of 
          the training conducted. I have experience evaluating operational efficiency in both 
          highly-engineered and high-volume manufacturing environments, as well as in developing 
          reporting tools to deliver those evaluations to senior management on an ongoing basis. 
          My experience ranges from working with very small nonprofits to Fortune 500 firms. 
          I am enthusiastic, self-motivated and data-driven. </p>
